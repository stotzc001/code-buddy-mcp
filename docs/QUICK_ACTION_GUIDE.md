‚úÖ **Workflow inventory documented**  

‚¨ú **Generate stub files** (Next step!)  
‚¨ú **Review and adjust metadata**  
‚¨ú **Map workflow relationships**  
‚¨ú **Populate detailed content**  

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Step 1: Review the Inventory
**File:** `docs/WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.md`

Review the complete workflow mapping to ensure:
- [ ] All 121 workflows are present
- [ ] IDs are sequential and logical
- [ ] Category assignments make sense
- [ ] Priorities are appropriate
- [ ] Tags are relevant and comprehensive

### Step 2: Generate Stub Files
**Run the stub generator:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Repos\code_buddy_mcp

# Run the stub generator
python scripts\generate_workflow_stubs.py
```

**This will create:**
- 121 workflow stub files in their proper category directories
- Each stub with Title, ID, Purpose, Tags, and placeholder sections
- Ready for detailed content population

### Step 3: Verify Generated Files

Check that files were created:
```bash
# Count files per category
dir workflows\development\*.md | measure-object
dir workflows\devops\*.md | measure-object
dir workflows\frontend-development\*.md | measure-object
# ... etc for all categories
```

Expected counts:
- Development: 30 files
- DevOps: 15 files
- Frontend Development: 11 files
- Machine Learning: 10 files
- Data Engineering: 12 files
- Architecture: 9 files
- Quality Assurance: 10 files
- Security: 6 files
- Version Control: 4 files
- Testing: 5 files
- Configuration Management: 4 files
- Project Management: 4 files
- Discovery: 1 file

**Total: 121 files**

### Step 4: Review Sample Stubs

Pick a few workflows to review:
- `workflows/development/type_annotation_addition.md`
- `workflows/devops/cicd_pipeline_setup.md`
- `workflows/frontend-development/react_component_creation.md`

Verify they have:
- ‚úÖ Correct title and ID
- ‚úÖ Proper category assignment
- ‚úÖ Appropriate priority and complexity
- ‚úÖ Relevant tags
- ‚úÖ Basic purpose statement
- ‚úÖ Placeholder sections for detailed content

## üìù What's in Each Stub File?

Each generated stub contains:

### ‚úÖ Complete Metadata
- Title
- ID (category-specific, sequential)
- Category
- Priority (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex/Expert)
- Estimated Time
- Last Updated date

### ‚úÖ Core Sections
- **Purpose** - What/Why/When with placeholders
- **Prerequisites** - Placeholder checklist
- **Implementation Steps** - 2 step templates
- **Verification Checklist** - Basic checklist
- **Common Issues** - Template for troubleshooting
- **Examples** - Template for examples
- **Best Practices** - DO/DON'T template
- **Related Workflows** - Placeholders for relationships
- **Tags** - Auto-generated relevant tags

### ‚¨ú To Be Completed
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Real code examples
- Specific verification steps
- Actual troubleshooting scenarios
- Real-world examples
- Concrete best practices
- Workflow relationship mappings

## üîÑ Workflow Relationship Mapping

After stub generation, we'll map relationships between workflows:

### Relationship Types

**Prerequisites** - Must do before this workflow:
```markdown
**Prerequisites:**
- [[dev-023]](../development/new_repo_scaffolding.md) - Sets up project structure
- [[dev-022]](../development/environment_initialization.md) - Configures environment
```

**Next Steps** - Natural progression after:
```markdown
**Next Steps:**
- [[tes-002]](../testing/test_writing.md) - Write tests for new code
- [[qua-007]](../quality-assurance/pr_creation_review.md) - Submit for review
```

**Alternatives** - Use instead when:
```markdown
**Alternatives:**
- [[dev-029]](../development/spike_research_workflow.md) - Use for exploratory work
```

**Complementary** - Use together with:
```markdown
**Complementary:**
- [[dvo-001]](../devops/application_monitoring_setup.md) - Monitor after deployment
```

## üé® Content Population Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Workflows (High Priority)
Focus on most critical workflows first:

**Development (8 workflows)**
- dev-004: Type Annotation Addition
- dev-022: Environment Initialization
- dev-023: New Repo Scaffolding
- dev-024: Pre-Commit Hook Setup
- dev-025: CI/CD Workflow Setup
- dev-027: FastAPI Endpoint Creation

**DevOps (9 workflows)**
- dvo-003: Backup Disaster Recovery
- dvo-004: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- dvo-008: Incident Response
- dvo-013: Emergency Hotfix
- dvo-014: Production Incident Response
- dvo-015: Rollback Procedure

**Security (3 workflows)**
- sec-002: Git History Cleanup
- sec-003: Secret Incident Response
- sec-004: Secret Management

**Quality Assurance (4 workflows)**
- qua-001: Code Review Checklist
- qua-007: PR Creation & Review
- qua-008: Quality Gate Execution

**Total Phase 1: ~25 workflows**

### Phase 2: Common Workflows (Medium Priority)
Standard development workflows:

- Testing workflows (5)
- Frontend workflows (11)
- Version control workflows (4)
- Configuration workflows (4)

**Total Phase 2: ~24 workflows**

### Phase 3: Specialized Workflows
Domain-specific workflows:

- Machine Learning (10)
- Data Engineering (12)
- Architecture (9)

**Total Phase 3: ~31 workflows**

### Phase 4: Supporting Workflows
Remaining workflows:

- Project Management (4)
- Discovery (1)
- Remaining Development workflows

**Total Phase 4: ~41 workflows**

## üìä Progress Tracking

Create a tracking spreadsheet or document:

| ID | Title | Category | Stub Created | Content Complete | Relationships Mapped | Reviewed | Final |
|----|-------|----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| dev-001 | Technical Debt | Development | ‚úÖ | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| dev-002 | Test Writing | Development | ‚úÖ | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## üöÄ Running the Stub Generator

### Option 1: Generate All Stubs at Once
```bash
python scripts\generate_workflow_stubs.py
```

### Option 2: Generate by Category (if you modify the script)
```python
# In the script, comment out categories you don't want yet
# For example, to only generate Development workflows:

SOURCE_WORKFLOWS = {
    "development": [...],
    # "devops": [...],  # Commented out
    # "frontend": [...],  # Commented out
}
```

### Option 3: Generate Individual Stubs
Create a helper script for single workflow generation if needed.
