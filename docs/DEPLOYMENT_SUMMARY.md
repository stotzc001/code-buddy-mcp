## 🚀 Your Deployment Path

### Right Now (5 minutes)
```powershell
cd C:\Repos\code_buddy_mcp
.\deploy.ps1
```

This script:
- Archives temporary files
- Creates .venv
- Installs dependencies
- Tests imports
- Shows next steps

### Then (5 minutes)
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Production-ready Code Buddy MCP with 117 workflows"
# Push to GitHub (see EXECUTE_NOW.md for commands)
```

### Then (10 minutes)
1. Deploy to Railway (see EXECUTE_NOW.md)
2. Add environment variables
3. Wait for deployment

### Then (5 minutes)
1. Configure Claude Desktop (see EXECUTE_NOW.md)
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Test with queries

### Finally (5 minutes)
Test these commands in Claude:
- "List all workflow categories"
- "Search for workflows about API design"
- "Show me workflow ID 1"

**Total Time: ~30 minutes**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### During Deployment
- Keep Railway logs open to watch deployment
- Test locally first before Railway
- Verify .venv is NOT committed to git

### After Deployment
- Share GitHub URL with team
- Share Railway dashboard access
- Monitor usage analytics
- Add custom workflows as needed

### For Your Team
- Give them the GitHub repo URL
- Give them the Railway URL (optional)
- Give them the Claude Desktop config
- Share EXECUTE_NOW.md for their setup

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### deploy.ps1 Fails
- Check you're in the right directory
- Ensure Python is installed
- Run commands manually from DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

### Git Push Fails
- Verify repository created on GitHub
- Check remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Try: `git push -u origin main --force`

### Railway Deploy Fails
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify all environment variables set
- Ensure requirements.txt is correct

### Claude Desktop Not Working
- Verify JSON syntax (use jsonlint.com)
- Check file paths use double backslashes: `C:\\Repos\\`
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check logs: Help > View Logs
