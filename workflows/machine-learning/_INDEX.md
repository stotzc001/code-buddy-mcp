# Machine Learning Workflows

## Category Overview
Comprehensive ML/AI workflows covering the entire machine learning lifecycle from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.

## Key Workflows
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train models with proper validation and metrics
- **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Create and select optimal features for models
- **MLOps Pipeline Setup**: Automate ML workflows with MLflow, Kubeflow, or similar
- **Deep Learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow)**: Build and train neural networks
- **Model Deployment Strategies**: Deploy models to production with REST APIs or batch processing
- **Data Preprocessing Pipelines**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for ML
- **A/B Testing for Models**: Compare model performance in production
- **Model Monitoring & Observability**: Track model drift, performance, and data quality
- **AutoML & Hyperparameter Optimization**: Automate model selection and tuning
- **ML Experiment Setup**: Track experiments with proper versioning and reproducibility
