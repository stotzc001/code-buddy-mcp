---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Session Planning and Context Setup

**What:** Define clear goals and provide comprehensive context to your AI assistant

**How:**
1. **Write down your objective** - Be specific about what you want to accomplish
2. **Gather relevant context** - Code files, documentation, error messages
3. **Define success criteria** - What does "done" look like?
4. **Set constraints** - Technology choices, coding standards, time limits

**Provide Context to AI:**
```markdown
# Good Context Template

**Goal:** [Specific feature/fix you want to implement]

**Current Situation:**
- Relevant code files: [list files]
- Current behavior: [description]
- Desired behavior: [description]

**Constraints:**
- Must use [framework/library]
- Follow [coding standard]
- Must be backward compatible
- Performance requirement: [if any]

**Questions:**
1. [Specific questions for AI]
```

**Example Context:**
```markdown
Goal: Add user authentication to FastAPI app

Current Situation:
- Have basic FastAPI app in main.py
- No authentication currently
- Users stored in PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy

Constraints:
- Use JWT tokens
- Follow OAuth2 password flow
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Must work with existing User model

Questions:
1. What's the best way to structure the auth routes?
2. Where should I store JWT secrets?
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Goal is specific and measurable
- [ ] All relevant context provided
- [ ] Constraints clearly stated
- [ ] Success criteria defined

**If This Fails:**
→ Break down the goal into smaller tasks
→ Start with a simpler version first

---

### Step 2: Iterative Development with AI

**What:** Work with AI in small, testable increments

**How:**
1. **Start small** - Request one component at a time
2. **Review each response** - Don't blindly accept code
3. **Test immediately** - Verify before moving forward
4. **Provide feedback** - Tell AI what works and what doesn't

**Effective Prompting Pattern:**
```markdown
# Request Pattern

1. "Let's start with [specific component]"
2. [AI provides code]
3. "This works, but [issue]. Can you modify to [fix]?"
4. [AI modifies]
5. "Perfect. Now let's add [next component]"
```

**Example Session Flow:**
```python
# Request 1: "Create a Pydantic model for user authentication"
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    password: str
    full_name: str

# Test it, provide feedback if needed

# Request 2: "Now create the password hashing utility"
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

# Request 3: "Create the JWT token generation function"
# ... continue building incrementally
```

**Best Practices:**
```python
# DO: Request specific, testable components
"Create a function that validates email format using regex"

# DON'T: Request everything at once
"Build the entire authentication system"

# DO: Provide examples
"Create a function like this, but for users instead of posts: [example]"

# DON'T: Be vague
"Make it better"
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Each component tested before moving forward
- [ ] Code reviewed and understood
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Error handling in place

**If This Fails:**
→ AI generating overcomplicated code? Ask for simpler version
→ Not working? Provide error messages and current state
→ Wrong direction? Restart with clearer context

---

### Step 3: Code Review and Critical Analysis

**What:** Critically evaluate AI-generated code before integration

**How:**
1. **Understand the code** - Don't merge code you don't understand
2. **Check for issues** - Security, performance, maintainability
3. **Verify best practices** - Does it follow your team's standards?
4. **Look for edge cases** - What could go wrong?

**Review Checklist:**
```python
# Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (proper escaping)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks

# Code Quality
- [ ] Functions are single-purpose and focused
- [ ] Variable names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Type hints included (Python)

# Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Appropriate data structures used
- [ ] No unnecessary loops or operations
- [ ] Database indexes considered

# Maintainability
- [ ] Code is readable and well-organized
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] Follows project conventions
- [ ] No code duplication
```

**Common AI Code Issues:**
```python
# Issue 1: Overly Generic Error Handling
# AI might generate:
try:
    result = do_something()
except Exception as e:  # Too broad!
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Better (tell AI to fix):
try:
    result = do_something()
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid value: {e}")
    raise
except DatabaseError as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
    raise

# Issue 2: Missing Edge Cases
# AI might generate:
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# Better (request improvements):
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

# Issue 3: Hardcoded Values
# AI might generate:
SECRET_KEY = "super-secret-key-123"

# Better (ask AI to use environment variables):
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
if not SECRET_KEY:
    raise ValueError("SECRET_KEY environment variable required")
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] All code reviewed and understood
- [ ] Security issues addressed
- [ ] Performance concerns resolved
- [ ] Code meets quality standards

**If This Fails:**
→ Ask AI to explain complex sections
→ Request simplification or refactoring
→ Break down into smaller pieces

---

### Step 4: Testing and Validation

**What:** Ensure AI-generated code works correctly with comprehensive tests

**How:**
1. **Write tests for AI code** - AI can help generate tests too
2. **Test edge cases** - Not just happy path
3. **Integration testing** - Does it work with existing code?
4. **Manual testing** - Try to break it

**Test Generation with AI:**
```python
# Request: "Generate pytest tests for the hash_password function"

import pytest
from auth import hash_password, verify_password

def test_hash_password():
    """Test password hashing"""
    password = "SecurePass123!"
    hashed = hash_password(password)
    
    # Hash should be different from original
    assert hashed != password
    
    # Hash should be bcrypt format
    assert hashed.startswith("$2b$")
    
    # Should be able to verify
    assert verify_password(password, hashed)

def test_hash_password_different_each_time():
    """Test that same password generates different hashes"""
    password = "SamePassword"
    hash1 = hash_password(password)
    hash2 = hash_password(password)
    
    # Hashes should be different (due to salt)
    assert hash1 != hash2
    
    # But both should verify correctly
    assert verify_password(password, hash1)
    assert verify_password(password, hash2)

def test_hash_empty_password():
    """Test edge case: empty password"""
    # Request AI to add this edge case
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        hash_password("")

def test_hash_very_long_password():
    """Test edge case: very long password"""
    long_password = "a" * 1000
    hashed = hash_password(long_password)
    assert verify_password(long_password, hashed)
```

**Testing Strategy:**
```bash
# 1. Run unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Check coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# 3. Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# 4. Manual testing
# Try the feature in the actual application
```

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- Empty inputs
- Null/None values
- Very large inputs
- Invalid formats
- Concurrent access
- Network failures (if applicable)
- Database unavailability

**Verification:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Integration tests successful
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Coverage acceptable (>80%)

**If This Fails:**
→ Work with AI to fix failing tests
→ Add missing test cases
→ Debug issues systematically

---

### Step 5: Refactoring and Optimization

**What:** Improve AI-generated code for production readiness

**How:**
1. **Identify improvements** - Performance, readability, maintainability
2. **Refactor with AI help** - Ask for specific improvements
3. **Maintain test coverage** - Tests should still pass
4. **Document changes** - Why you made them

**Refactoring Requests:**
```python
# Request 1: "Refactor this to reduce code duplication"
# Before:
def get_user_by_email(email: str):
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        user = session.query(User).filter(User.email == email).first()
        return user
    finally:
        session.close()

def get_user_by_id(user_id: int):
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        user = session.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
        return user
    finally:
        session.close()

# After AI refactoring:
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def get_db():
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield session
    finally:
        session.close()

def get_user_by_email(email: str):
    with get_db() as session:
        return session.query(User).filter(User.email == email).first()

def get_user_by_id(user_id: int):
    with get_db() as session:
        return session.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```python
# Request 2: "Optimize this query to avoid N+1 problem"
# Before:
users = session.query(User).all()
for user in users:
    user.posts  # Triggers separate query for each user!

# After AI optimization:
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

users = session.query(User).options(
    joinedload(User.posts)
).all()
# All data loaded in one query
```

**Code Organization:**
```python
# Request 3: "Organize these functions into a class"
# Help AI structure code better for your project
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- [ ] Performance improved (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests still passing
- [ ] No functionality broken

**If This Fails:**
→ Revert changes and try smaller refactorings
→ Ask AI for alternative approaches

---

### Step 6: Documentation and Comments

**What:** Document the AI-assisted implementation

**How:**
1. **Add docstrings** - AI can help generate these
2. **Comment complex logic** - Explain why, not what
3. **Update README** - Document new features
4. **Create examples** - Help future developers

**Documentation with AI:**
```python
# Request: "Add comprehensive docstrings to these functions"

def authenticate_user(email: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    """
    Authenticate a user by email and password.
    
    Args:
        email: User's email address
        password: Plain text password to verify
        
    Returns:
        User object if authentication successful, None otherwise
        
    Raises:
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails
        
    Example:
        >>> user = authenticate_user("user@example.com", "password123")
        >>> if user:
        ...     print(f"Welcome {user.full_name}")
        ... else:
        ...     print("Invalid credentials")
    
    Note:
        Password is hashed using bcrypt before comparison.
        Failed attempts are logged for security monitoring.
    """
    try:
        with get_db() as session:
            user = session.query(User).filter(
                User.email == email
            ).first()
            
            if not user or not verify_password(password, user.hashed_password):
                logger.warning(f"Failed login attempt for {email}")
                return None
                
            logger.info(f"Successful login for {email}")
            return user
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Authentication error: {e}")
        raise
```

**README Updates:**
```markdown
# Request: "Generate a README section for the authentication feature"

## Authentication

This application uses JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing.

### Setup

1. Set environment variables:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
export ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

2. Create first user:
```python
from auth import create_user

user = create_user(
    email="admin@example.com",
    password="secure-password",
    full_name="Admin User"
)
```

### Usage

```python
# Authenticate user
from auth import authenticate_user, create_access_token

user = authenticate_user(email, password)
if user:
    token = create_access_token(user.id)
    # Use token for subsequent requests
```

### Security Features

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Failed login attempts logged
- Email validation on registration
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] All functions have docstrings
- [ ] Complex logic commented
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] Examples provided

**If This Fails:**
→ Ask AI to generate documentation
→ Review and customize AI-generated docs

---

### Step 7: Learning and Pattern Recognition

**What:** Extract reusable patterns and learn from the session

**How:**
1. **Identify patterns** - What worked well?
2. **Note pain points** - What was difficult?
3. **Extract templates** - Save prompts that worked
4. **Update your process** - Improve for next time

**Pattern Extraction:**
```markdown
# Save This Pattern: Authentication Endpoint

## What I Learned
- Breaking auth into small pieces (models, utils, routes) works better
- Providing security constraints upfront gets better results
- AI suggests overcomplicated solutions without constraints

## Effective Prompts
1. "Create a Pydantic model for [X] with validation for [constraints]"
2. "Implement [function] following [standard/pattern]"
3. "Add error handling for [specific errors]"

## Code Templates to Reuse
- JWT token generation pattern
- Password hashing utilities
- OAuth2 password flow structure

## Things to Avoid
- Asking for "complete system" at once
- Accepting code without security review
- Skipping edge case testing
```

**Create Reusable Snippets:**
```python
# Save to your snippets library
# ~/.code_snippets/fastapi_auth_pattern.py

"""
FastAPI Authentication Pattern
Generated with AI assistance on 2025-10-25
Works well for: JWT-based auth with bcrypt
"""

# [Your refined, tested code here]
```

**Session Retrospective:**
```markdown
## Session Retrospective

**What Went Well:**
- AI quickly generated boilerplate
- Good suggestions for error handling
- Helpful with test generation

**What Could Improve:**
- Need to provide more context about existing code
- Should start with simpler version
- Review security implications earlier

**Action Items:**
- Create context template for future sessions
- Build library of working prompts
- Set up security checklist before AI sessions
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Patterns documented
- [ ] Effective prompts saved
- [ ] Lessons learned captured
- [ ] Templates created for reuse

**If This Fails:**
→ Keep a session log for later review

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: AI Generates Overcomplicated Solutions

**Symptoms:**
- Too many abstractions
- Over-engineered patterns
- Unnecessary dependencies

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Add this to your prompt:
"Keep it simple. Use standard Python patterns.
No unnecessary abstractions. Focus on readability."
```

**Prevention:**
- Start with "simple version" requests
- Provide constraints upfront
- Show examples of your preferred style

---

### Issue: AI Code Doesn't Match Project Style

**Symptoms:**
- Different naming conventions
- Inconsistent patterns
- Doesn't follow team standards

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Provide style guide in prompt:
"Follow these conventions:
- Use snake_case for functions
- Type hints on all functions
- Google-style docstrings
- Max line length 88 chars"

# Or show examples:
"Generate a function like this existing one: [example]"
```

**Prevention:**
- Create a project style prompt template
- Share code examples from your codebase
- Reference your style guide

---

### Issue: Generated Code Has Security Vulnerabilities

**Symptoms:**
- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection risks
- Missing input validation
- Inadequate error handling

**Solution:**
```python
# Review with security checklist
# Ask AI to fix specific issues:
"This code has a SQL injection vulnerability. 
Use parameterized queries instead."

# Example fix:
# Bad:
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Good:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**Prevention:**
- Always include security requirements in prompts
- Review all AI code with security mindset
- Use security linting tools
- Never trust AI code without review

---

### Issue: Context Gets Lost During Long Sessions

**Symptoms:**
- AI forgets earlier decisions
- Contradicts previous suggestions
- Loses track of project structure

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Periodically summarize:
"So far we've implemented:
1. [Component A] 
2. [Component B]

Now let's add [Component C], which should:
- Work with [Component A]
- Follow the same pattern as [Component B]"
```

**Prevention:**
- Keep sessions focused (30-60 min)
- Take notes on decisions
- Provide context in each prompt
- Reference earlier code by name

---

### Issue: Tests Are Inadequate

**Symptoms:**
- Only happy path tested
- Missing edge cases
- Low coverage
- Tests don't catch bugs

**Solution:**
```python
# Request specific test cases:
"Add tests for these edge cases:
1. Empty input
2. None value
3. Very large input
4. Invalid format
5. Database connection failure"

# Ask for specific testing approaches:
"Generate property-based tests using Hypothesis"
"Add integration tests that test the full flow"
```

**Prevention:**
- Always request edge case tests
- Review test coverage
- Ask AI to identify missed cases

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding Authentication to FastAPI App

**Context:**
```markdown
Goal: Add JWT authentication
Current: Basic FastAPI app with user CRUD
Constraints: OAuth2 password flow, bcrypt, PostgreSQL
```

**Session Flow:**
```python
# 1. Request data models
"Create Pydantic models for user authentication"

# 2. Request password utilities
"Create password hashing and verification functions using bcrypt"

# 3. Request JWT functions
"Create functions to generate and validate JWT tokens"

# 4. Request auth routes
"Create FastAPI routes for login and token refresh"

# 5. Request dependency
"Create a get_current_user dependency for protected routes"

# 6. Review, test, refactor
# 7. Document and commit
```

**Result:** Complete auth system in 45 minutes, 95% test coverage

---

### Example 2: Refactoring Complex Function

**Context:**
```python
# Request: "Help me refactor this complex function"

def process_data(data):
    # 150 lines of nested logic
    result = []
    for item in data:
        if item.get('type') == 'A':
            # 30 lines
        elif item.get('type') == 'B':
            # 40 lines
        # ... more conditions
    return result
```

**AI-Assisted Refactoring:**
```python
# Step 1: "Extract each type handler into a separate function"
def handle_type_a(item):
    # Extracted logic
    pass

def handle_type_b(item):
    # Extracted logic
    pass

# Step 2: "Create a dispatcher pattern"
HANDLERS = {
    'A': handle_type_a,
    'B': handle_type_b,
    # ...
}

def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        handler = HANDLERS.get(item.get('type'))
        if handler:
            result.append(handler(item))
    return result

# Much cleaner!
```

---

### Example 3: Debugging with AI

**Context:**
```python
# Error: Intermittent database connection failures

# Request: "Help me debug this error"
# [Provide error message, stack trace, and relevant code]
```

**AI-Assisted Debugging:**
```markdown
AI suggests:
1. Connection pool exhaustion
2. Missing connection cleanup
3. Transactions not properly closed

# Test each hypothesis
# Add logging
# Implement AI's suggested fixes
# Verify resolution
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ **Start with clear, specific goals**
✅ **Provide comprehensive context**

✅ **Review all generated code**
✅ **Test immediately and thoroughly**
✅ **Think critically about suggestions**
✅ **Document patterns that work**
✅ **Ask AI to explain complex code**
✅ **Refactor for production quality**
✅ **Maintain code ownership**

### DON'T:
❌ **Blindly accept AI code without review**
❌ **Skip security considerations**
❌ **Request entire systems at once**
❌ **Ignore test coverage**
❌ **Commit code you don't understand**
❌ **Skip edge case handling**
❌ **Forget to provide constraints**
❌ **Use AI as a crutch for learning**

❌ **Deploy without thorough testing**

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Context-Rich Prompting

```markdown
# Template for complex requests
**Task:** [Specific goal]

**Current Code:**
```[language]
[Relevant existing code]
```

**Requirements:**
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

**Constraints:**
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

**Question:** [Specific question]
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Refinement

```python
# 1. Get basic version
"Create a simple [X]"

# 2. Add features incrementally  
"Now add [feature Y]"

# 3. Handle edge cases
"Add error handling for [case Z]"

# 4. Optimize
"Improve performance of [component]"
```

### Pattern 3: Test-Driven with AI

```python
# 1. Define tests first
"Generate tests for a function that [does X]"

# 2. Implement to pass tests
"Implement the function to pass these tests"

# 3. Refactor
"Refactor this implementation to be more efficient"
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Understanding Context

**Problem:** AI generates code that doesn't fit your project

**Debug Steps:**
1. Provide more context about project structure
2. Share relevant code files
3. Explain architectural decisions
4. Give examples from your codebase

---

### Generated Code Not Working

**Problem:** AI code has bugs or doesn't run

**Debug Steps:**
1. Share full error message with AI
