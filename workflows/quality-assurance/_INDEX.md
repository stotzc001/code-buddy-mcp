# Quality Assurance Workflows

## Category Overview
Code quality, static analysis, linting, type checking, and quality gate workflows to maintain high code standards.

## Key Workflows
- **Code Review Checklist**: Systematic code review process
- **Quality Gate Execution**: Automated quality checks before merging
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify areas with insufficient test coverage
- **Complexity Reduction**: Refactor complex code for better maintainability
- **Graduation Lite to Strict**: Progressively improve code quality standards
- **Deviation Protocol**: Handle exceptions to quality standards
- **Mypy Type Error Fixing**: Resolve type checking errors
- **Ruff Error Resolution**: Fix linting errors and warnings
- **PR Creation & Review**: Create well-documented pull requests

## Related Categories
- **Testing**: For test-related quality checks
- **Development**: For coding standards
- **Version Control**: For PR workflows

## Quality Assurance Best Practices
- Enforce quality gates in CI/CD
- Use static analysis tools (mypy, ruff, eslint)
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Review all code before merging
- Monitor code complexity metrics
- Document deviations from standards
- Continuously improve quality standards
