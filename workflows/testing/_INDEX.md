# Testing Workflows

## Category Overview
Comprehensive testing workflows covering unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, test data generation, and testing best practices.

## Key Workflows
- **Test Writing**: Write effective unit and integration tests
- **Test Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies and services
- **Test Data Generation**: Generate realistic test data and fixtures
- **Test Failure Investigation**: Debug and fix failing tests
- **Performance Regression Investigation**: Identify and fix performance regressions
- **Property-Based Testing**: Use hypothesis/QuickCheck for property-based tests
- **Component Testing Strategy**: Test React/Vue components effectively
- **E2E Testing Workflow**: Set up and maintain end-to-end tests
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify untested code paths

- **Development**: For test-driven development practices

## Testing Best Practices
- Write tests before fixing bugs (TDD)
- Aim for high coverage but focus on critical paths
- Keep tests fast and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
