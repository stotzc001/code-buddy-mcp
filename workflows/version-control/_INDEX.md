# Version Control Workflows

## Category Overview
Git and version control workflows for branching strategies, conflict resolution, commit management, and collaborative development.

## Key Workflows

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Resolve merge conflicts effectively
- **Commit Message Correction**: Fix commit messages and history
- **Git History Cleanup**: Clean up Git history (solo developer workflows)
- **Version Release & Tagging**: Tag releases and manage semantic versioning

- Rebase to keep history clean (solo development)
- Never force push to shared branches
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Review code before merging
