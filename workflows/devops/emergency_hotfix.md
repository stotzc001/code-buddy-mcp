# Emergency Hotfix

**ID:** dvo-013  
**Category:** DevOps  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Complexity:** Complex  
**Estimated Time:** 30-120 minutes (varies by severity)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25

---

## Purpose

**What:** Execute rapid deployment of critical bug fixes to production with minimal risk and maximum traceability.

**Why:** 
- Production issues can cause revenue loss, data corruption, or security breaches
- Normal deployment cycles (hours/days) are too slow for critical issues
- Quick action required while maintaining safety and quality

**When to use:**
- **Critical severity issues:**
  - Complete service outage
  - Data corruption or loss
  - Security vulnerabilities being exploited
  - Payment processing failures
  - Legal/compliance violations
  
- **NOT for:**
  - Feature requests (use normal deployment)
  - Minor bugs that can wait
  - Performance optimizations
  - Cosmetic issues

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- [ ] Production access credentials
- [ ] Incident commander authority/approval
- [ ] Monitoring access (logs, metrics, alerts)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline access
- [ ] Rollback capability verified
- [ ] Communication channel set up (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)

**Check before starting:**
```bash
# Verify you have production access
kubectl get nodes  # For k8s
aws sts get-caller-identity  # For AWS
heroku auth:whoami  # For Heroku

# Verify git status
git status  # Clean working directory
git remote -v  # Confirm repository

# Check current production version
curl https://api.yourservice.com/health | jq .version

# Verify rollback capability
git tag --list | grep prod- | tail -5
```

**Emergency contacts ready:**
- [ ] On-call engineer
- [ ] Engineering manager
- [ ] Platform/SRE team
- [ ] Customer support lead

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Assess and Triage (5-10 minutes)

**What:** Quickly determine severity, impact, and whether hotfix is justified.

**How:**

1. **Gather information:**
```bash
# Check error rates
datadog query "service:api status:error" --last 1h

# Check recent deployments
git log --oneline -10 origin/production

# Check monitoring dashboards
open https://dashboard.datadog.com/production

# Review incident reports
gh issue list --label "incident" --state open
```

2. **Assess severity:**

| Severity | Criteria | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Complete outage, data loss | Immediate | Service down, payments failing, data corruption |
| **P1 - High** | Major functionality broken | < 2 hours | Key feature broken, significant user impact |
| **P2 - Medium** | Limited impact | < 24 hours | Minor feature broken, workaround available |
| **P3 - Low** | Minimal impact | Normal cycle | Cosmetic issues, edge cases |

3. **Decision matrix:**
```
Is it P0/P1? YES ‚Üí Continue with hotfix
             NO  ‚Üí Schedule for normal deployment

Can it wait 4 hours? YES ‚Üí Use normal deployment
                     NO  ‚Üí Continue with hotfix

Is root cause understood? YES ‚Üí Continue with hotfix
                          NO  ‚Üí Stabilize first, fix later
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Severity determined (P0 or P1 only)
- [ ] Impact quantified (users affected, revenue impact)
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Hotfix justified (cannot wait for normal cycle)
- [ ] Incident commander notified

**If This Fails:**
‚Üí If unsure about root cause, focus on mitigation first (rollback, feature flag)
‚Üí If impact unclear, check with customer support for user reports

---

### Step 2: Create Hotfix Branch (5 minutes)

**What:** Create an isolated branch from production for the emergency fix.

**How:**

```bash
# 1. Start from latest production
git fetch origin
git checkout production  # or main, master depending on workflow
git pull origin production

# 2. Create hotfix branch with descriptive name
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-processing-fix-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Alternative naming patterns:
# hotfix/issue-1234-payment-fix
# hotfix/CRITICAL-service-down
# hotfix/P0-data-corruption

# 3. Verify starting point
git log --oneline -1
# Should match production deployment

# 4. Create tracking issue
gh issue create \
  --title "HOTFIX: Payment processing failure" \
  --label "hotfix,P0,incident" \
  --body "Production issue requiring immediate fix.
  
Root cause: [description]
Impact: [affected users/revenue]
Fix: [brief description]
Incident: [link to incident doc]"
```

**Branch naming convention:**
```
hotfix/[severity]-[brief-description]-[date]

Examples:
‚úÖ hotfix/P0-payment-gateway-20250125
‚úÖ hotfix/CRITICAL-auth-bypass-20250125
‚úÖ hotfix/data-corruption-fix-20250125

‚ùå hotfix/fix-bug
‚ùå fix-payment
‚ùå emergency
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Hotfix branch created
- [ ] Branch starts from production HEAD
- [ ] Branch follows naming convention
- [ ] Tracking issue created
- [ ] Team notified in Slack

---

### Step 3: Implement Minimal Fix (15-30 minutes)

**What:** Write the smallest possible fix that resolves the critical issue.

**How:**

**Principles:**
1. **Minimal scope** - Fix ONLY the critical issue
2. **Low risk** - Avoid refactoring or cleanup
3. **Tested** - Include tests that would catch this bug
4. **Reversible** - Easy to rollback if needed

**Example Fix:**
```python
# Bad: Large refactoring in hotfix
def process_payment(amount, currency, user_id):
    # Refactored entire payment system...  ‚ùå TOO MUCH
    
# Good: Minimal targeted fix
def process_payment(amount, currency, user_id):
    # Added missing validation that caused the bug
    if amount <= 0:  # ‚úÖ MINIMAL FIX
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    
    # Rest of code unchanged
    return payment_gateway.charge(amount, currency, user_id)
```

**Testing the fix:**
```bash
# Run relevant tests
pytest tests/test_payments.py -v

# Add regression test
# tests/test_payments.py
def test_payment_rejects_negative_amount():
    """Regression test for hotfix/P0-payment-gateway-20250125"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Amount must be positive"):
        process_payment(amount=-10, currency="USD", user_id=123)

# Run full test suite if time permits
pytest tests/ --maxfail=1

# Test locally with production-like data
docker-compose up -d
python scripts/test_payment_flow.py
```

**Code review checklist:**
```markdown
Hotfix Review Checklist:
- [ ] Fixes only the critical issue
- [ ] No scope creep (refactoring, cleanup)
- [ ] Includes test that catches the bug
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Safe to rollback
- [ ] Documented with comments
- [ ] Error handling added if missing
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Fix implements minimal change
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] Code reviewed (even if brief)
- [ ] Fix confirmed to resolve root cause

**If This Fails:**
‚Üí If tests fail, fix the tests or the code (don't skip tests)
‚Üí If fix is too large, consider feature flag to disable broken feature instead

---

### Step 4: Fast-Track Review & Merge (10-15 minutes)

**What:** Get emergency approval and merge to production.

**How:**

```bash
# 1. Commit with clear message
git add -A
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Fix payment processing negative amount bug

Problem: Payments were processed with negative amounts causing refunds
Root Cause: Missing validation in process_payment()
Solution: Add amount > 0 validation
Impact: Prevents revenue loss from accidental refunds

Fixes #1234
Incident: https://company.pagerduty.com/incidents/123"

# 2. Push and create PR
git push origin hotfix/P0-payment-gateway-20250125

gh pr create \
  --title "üö® HOTFIX: Fix payment processing negative amounts" \
  --body "## Emergency Hotfix

**Severity:** P0 - Critical
**Impact:** Payment processing failures
**Root Cause:** Missing validation
**Fix:** Added amount validation

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Manual testing in staging
- [x] Regression test added

## Rollback Plan
Revert commit: \`git revert <commit>\`

cc: @oncall @engineering-manager" \
  --label "hotfix,P0,urgent" \
  --assignee @oncall

# 3. Request emergency review
slack-notify "#engineering-oncall" \
  "üö® HOTFIX PR ready for emergency review: [PR link]
  
  Issue: Payment processing bug
  Impact: $X revenue at risk
  Need approval in next 10 minutes"

# 4. Merge after approval (skip normal review process)
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

**Fast-track approval criteria:**
```
‚úÖ Can fast-track if:
- P0/P1 severity confirmed
- Fix is minimal and targeted
- Tests pass
- At least 1 senior engineer reviewed
- Rollback plan documented

‚ùå Cannot fast-track if:
- Large code changes
- Tests failing
- No reviewer available
- Rollback unclear
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] PR created with full context
- [ ] Emergency reviewer assigned
- [ ] Tests passing in CI
- [ ] PR approved
- [ ] Branch merged to production

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (5-15 minutes)

**What:** Deploy the hotfix to production with monitoring.

**How:**

```bash
# 1. Trigger production deployment
# (Method depends on your CI/CD setup)

# GitHub Actions
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml \
  --ref hotfix/P0-payment-gateway-20250125

# Jenkins
jenkins-cli build "production-deploy" \
  -p BRANCH="production" \
  -p VERSION="hotfix-20250125"

# Manual deployment (if needed)
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Kubernetes
kubectl set image deployment/api \
  api=myapp:hotfix-20250125 \
  -n production

kubectl rollout status deployment/api -n production

# 2. Monitor deployment
watch kubectl get pods -n production

# 3. Tag the hotfix
git tag -a "hotfix-20250125-payment-fix" -m "Emergency hotfix for payment processing"
git push origin hotfix-20250125-payment-fix
```

**Deployment checklist:**
```markdown
Pre-deployment:
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard open
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Error tracking prepared

During deployment:
- [ ] Deployment triggered
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] No new errors in logs
- [ ] Metrics stable

Post-deployment:
- [ ] Fix verified in production
- [ ] Monitoring shows improvement
- [ ] Stakeholders updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] No new errors in logs
- [ ] Original issue resolved
- [ ] Metrics returning to normal

**If This Fails:**
‚Üí **ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY** - See Step 6

---

### Step 6: Monitor and Verify Fix (15-30 minutes)

**What:** Confirm the hotfix resolved the issue without introducing new problems.

**How:**

```bash
# 1. Check error rates
datadog query "service:api status:error" --last 10m

# 2. Check key metrics
curl https://api.yourservice.com/metrics | jq .
# Look for:
# - Error rate decreased
# - Response time normal
# - Success rate improved

# 3. Test the fixed functionality
curl -X POST https://api.yourservice.com/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": -10, "currency": "USD"}' \
  # Should now return 400 error

curl -X POST https://api.yourservice.com/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100, "currency": "USD"}' \
  # Should work correctly

# 4. Check logs for the fix
kubectl logs -l app=api --tail=100 -n production | grep "Amount must be positive"

# 5. Monitor dashboards for 15-30 minutes
# - Error rates
# - API response times
# - Database connections
# - Queue depths
# - User-reported issues
```

**Success criteria:**
```
‚úÖ Fix is successful if:
- Original issue no longer occurring
- Error rate returned to normal
- No new errors introduced
- Key metrics stable
- Customer reports decreasing

‚ö†Ô∏è Partial success if:
- Issue reduced but not eliminated
- May need additional fix

‚ùå Failed if:
- Issue still occurring
- New errors introduced
- Metrics worse than before
‚Üí ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Original issue resolved
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] Metrics stable for 15+ minutes
- [ ] Customer support confirms fix

---

## Verification Checklist

After completing this workflow:

- [ ] Critical issue resolved
- [ ] Hotfix deployed to production
- [ ] Monitoring shows improvement
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Hotfix documented and tagged
- [ ] Post-mortem scheduled
- [ ] Customer support notified
- [ ] Backport to development branch completed
- [ ] Technical debt ticket created (if needed)

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Hotfix Makes Things Worse

**Symptoms:**
- New errors appearing
- Metrics degrading
- Different functionality broken

**Solution:**
```bash
# IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
# Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api -n production

# Git revert
git revert HEAD
git push origin production

# Feature flag disable
curl -X POST https://api.yourservice.com/admin/features \
  -d '{"payment_validation": false}'

# Verify rollback successful
curl https://api.yourservice.com/health
```

**Prevention:**
- Smaller, more targeted fixes
- Better testing before deployment
- Feature flags for risky changes
- Canary deployments

---

### Issue: Can't Reproduce Issue in Staging

**Symptoms:**
- Bug occurs in production only
- Cannot test fix locally
- Staging behaves differently

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use production data (safely)
# 1. Copy anonymized production data
pg_dump production_db | \
  python scripts/anonymize.py | \
  psql staging_db

# 2. Use production traffic sampling
kubectl port-forward svc/api 8080:80 -n production
# Test against production (read-only)

# 3. Deploy to canary first
./scripts/deploy.sh canary
# 1% of traffic goes to canary

# Monitor canary
watch 'kubectl logs -l version=canary --tail=50'
```

**Prevention:**
- Production-like staging environment
- Regular data synchronization
- Synthetic production monitoring

---

### Issue: Fix Takes Too Long to Deploy

**Symptoms:**
- CI/CD pipeline taking 30+ minutes
- Too many manual approval gates
- Deployment process too complex

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use emergency fast-track deployment
# Skip non-critical gates
./scripts/deploy-emergency.sh production \
  --skip-integration-tests \
  --skip-approval \
  --fast

# Or deploy directly (last resort)
git push production hotfix/emergency:master
heroku releases:rollback v1234

# Document what you skipped
echo "Skipped full test suite due to P0 emergency" >> incident.log
```

**Prevention:**
- Streamline deployment pipeline
- Separate critical vs non-critical checks
- Pre-approved emergency deployment process
- Feature flags to avoid full deployments

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Payment Gateway Timeout

**Context:** Payment API timing out, causing revenue loss.

**Execution:**
```bash
# 1. Identify issue
grep "payment_timeout" logs/production.log
# Found: timeout set to 5s, gateway needs 10s

# 2. Create hotfix
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-timeout-20250125

# 3. Fix (minimal change)
# Before: PAYMENT_TIMEOUT = 5
# After:  PAYMENT_TIMEOUT = 15

# 4. Test locally
curl -X POST localhost:8000/payment -d '...' -w '%{time_total}'
# Confirmed: completes in 8-12 seconds

# 5. Deploy
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Increase payment timeout to 15s"
./scripts/deploy.sh production --hotfix

# 6. Monitor
datadog query "payment.success_rate" --last 30m
# Success rate: 95% ‚Üí 99.5% ‚úÖ
```

**Result:** Payment success rate restored within 20 minutes.

---

### Example 2: Memory Leak Causing Crashes

**Context:** Application crashing every 2 hours due to memory leak.

**Execution:**
```bash
# 1. Quick mitigation: increase restart frequency
kubectl scale deployment/api --replicas=6
kubectl set probe deployment/api \
  --liveness --period-seconds=300

# 2. Root cause: memory leak in cache
# Review heap dump
jmap -dump:live,file=heap.bin $(pgrep java)
jhat heap.bin

# 3. Hotfix: add cache eviction
git checkout -b hotfix/cache-eviction-20250125

# Code change:
# Before: cache = {}
# After:  cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=3600)

# 4. Test memory growth
python scripts/memory_test.py
# Confirmed: memory stable over 6 hours

# 5. Deploy with gradual rollout
kubectl set image deployment/api api=myapp:hotfix-v2 \
  && kubectl rollout pause deployment/api
# Monitor 10% of pods for 30 minutes
kubectl rollout resume deployment/api

# 6. Monitor for 4 hours
while true; do
  kubectl top pods | grep api
  sleep 300
done
# Memory stable ‚úÖ
```

**Result:** Service stabilized, memory usage controlled.

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Document everything (commands, decisions, timestamps)
‚úÖ Communicate constantly (Slack, PagerDuty, email)
‚úÖ Make minimal changes (fix only the critical issue)
‚úÖ Test the fix (even if quick smoke tests)
‚úÖ Monitor after deployment (watch for 30+ minutes)
‚úÖ Schedule post-mortem within 24 hours
‚úÖ Tag and document the hotfix
‚úÖ Backport fix to development branch

### DON'T:
‚ùå Skip testing "because it's urgent"
‚ùå Add features or refactoring
‚ùå Deploy without rollback plan
‚ùå Work alone (always have a second person)
‚ùå Skip documentation "will do later"
‚ùå Ignore monitoring after deployment
‚ùå Forget to notify stakeholders
‚ùå Skip post-mortem
