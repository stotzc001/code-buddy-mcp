# üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## What We Fixed
Your Code Buddy MCP had database schema mismatches. We've fixed the code, but **you need to restart the MCP server** for changes to take effect.

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Restart MCP Server
Your MCP server is running with old code. You need to restart it:

**Option A - If running as a service:**
1. Stop the MCP server process
2. Restart it

**Option B - If running in terminal:**
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where MCP is running
2. Restart with: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\server.py`

### Step 2: Test the Fix
Once restarted, test these commands:

```python
# This should work now (it was failing before)
get_workflow(590)

# This already works
search_workflows("Docker CI/CD")

# Test other functions
list_categories()
get_prerequisites(590)
```

## What We Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Added missing `prerequisites` column to database
2. ‚úÖ Fixed `get_workflow_by_id()` to use correct column name (`overview` instead of `content`)
3. ‚úÖ Code now correctly:
   - Queries database column `overview`
   - Returns it as API key `content` (for consistency)

## Expected Results After Restart

### Before (ERROR):
```
Error: column "content" does not exist
```

### After (SUCCESS):
```
# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**ID:** 590 | **Name:** ci_cd_workflow
**Category:** Development > Automation

## Description
...complete workflow content...
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check that you restarted the MCP server (very important!)
2. Verify the file was updated: 
   ```powershell
   notepad src\tools\workflow_search.py
   # Line 274 should say: id, name, title, description, overview,
   # Line 284 should say: "content": row[4],  # Database column is 'overview'
   ```
3. Check for any error messages when the server starts
4. Share the error message with me

## Summary

**Problem:** MCP couldn't retrieve workflow content due to wrong column name
**Solution:** Fixed code to use correct database column (`overview`)
**Status:** Code fixed ‚úÖ | Server restart needed ‚è≥
**Expected Time:** 30 seconds to restart and test

## Next Steps After Verification

Once you confirm it's working:
1. Test all MCP functions (search, get, prerequisites, categories, track_usage)
2. Consider adding the MCP to your Claude Desktop configuration
3. Start using it for real workflow lookups!
